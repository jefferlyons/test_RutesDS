                <p>ShortRoute is a service designed to apply today's technology to school transportation management.
                    We wish to provide a robust platform that simplifies the organization and logistics required for such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We implement a database designed to store the critical information that the system requires, and the tools to manage it.
                    We also offer tools for parents to track the buses and control their information. That way, they know their children are in proper care.
                    We also have a helping system for drivers using the latest GPS technology. The system calculates the optimal route to pick up all the students and then guides the driver through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to fullfil our client's expectations, and that our service simplifies transportation management forever.
